# RARM-mk1

## WepIoPi web app and inverse kinematics for controlling the RARM mk1

A robotic arm actuates by six stepper motors and controlled from your computer. The **PI** is running a **WebIoPi** server that which runs macros on the **PI**. The **PI** calculates inverse kinematics and then uses **TMC2208** stepper drivers to drive the [**FYSETC**](https://www.amazon.com/FYSETC-Printer-Extruder-47-2inch-Accessories/dp/B099JMJNH2/ref=sr_1_18) stepper motors.
